Hi there! I'm Ignacio Hernandez, a graduate in Systems and Computation Engineering from the esteemed Technological University of Panama. 
I've always liked the cybersecurity branch, specially the penetration testing side of it. In this page I will share writeups of machines, tools,
CTFs, and anything I find interesting realted to cybersecurity.

## About My Journey

Since I was about 12, I realized that tech was my passion. Everyday I would investigate and mess around with new concepts which eventually led me to the cybersecurity
realm. I started learning about linux, networking, types of attacks, etc... which really helped me in the future to achieve my title as a Systems and Computation Engineer.
I also recently got certified as a CCNA which helped me acquire a great foundation of many networking concepts that will help me in future penetration tests. The next milestone
that I want to achieve is to obtain the OSCP, I'll be practicing a lot and sharing my experience on this page.
